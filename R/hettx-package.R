#' Fisherian and Neymanian Methods for Detecting and Measuring Treatment Effect Variation
#'
#' This package implements methods developed by Ding, Feller, and Miratrix
#' (JRSS-B, 2016) "Randomization Inference for Treatment Effect Variation", for
#' validly testing whether there is unexplained variation in treatment effects
#' across observations. The package also implements methods introduced in Ding,
#' Feller, and Miratrix (JASA, 2019) "Decomposing Treatment Effect Variation", for
#' measuring the degree of treatment effect heterogeneity explained by
#' covariates. The package includes wrapper functions implementing the proposed
#' methods, as well as helper functions for analyzing and visualizing the
#' results of the tests.
