Description: Implements methods developed by Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2016) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12124> <arXiv:1412.5000>,
    and Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2018) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1407322> <arXiv:1605.06566>
    for testing whether there is unexplained variation in treatment effects across observations, and for characterizing
    the extent of the explained and unexplained variation in treatment effects. The package includes wrapper functions
    implementing the proposed methods, as well as helper functions for analyzing and visualizing the results of the test.
