Description: Implements methods developed by Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2016) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12124> <arXiv:1412.5000>,
    and Ding, Feller, and Miratrix (2018) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1407322> <arXiv:1605.06566>
    for testing whether there is unexplained variation in treatment effects across observations.
    The package includes wrapper functions implementing the proposed methods, as well
    as helper functions for analyzing and visualizing the results of the test.
